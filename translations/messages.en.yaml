dataTransferInfoText: The transfer of data for processing is done in moste companies - for example for the use of external data centers or services (e.g. SaaS), cloud computing or maintenance of IT systems by a service provider. In these cases there is usually a data transfer involved, which means that special measures need to be met to ensure the GDPR isn't violated.

orderProcessingInfoText: If your organisation processes data for an external person or organisation, this is referred to as "order processing".

In order for the order processing to be contractually regulated, it is important to conclude an order processing contract with the client.
